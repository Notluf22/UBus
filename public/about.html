    <h1>UBus – Your Route, Your Time</h1>

    <p><strong>UBus</strong> is an innovative ticket booking and real-time tracking system designed for <strong>short-distance government buses</strong>. Inspired by solutions like <em>Where is My Train</em>, UBus digitizes the local commute experience with smart booking and live location tracking.</p>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>UBus empowers commuters by offering:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Online booking for general, short-distance bus tickets</li>
      <li>Live tracking of buses via GPS</li>
      <li>Accurate Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) at stops</li>
      <li>Contactless travel with digital passes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges in Traditional Transport</h2>
    <p>Rural and semi-urban transport systems often lack:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Real-time bus arrival information</li>
      <li>Online booking or payment options</li>
      <li>Reliable schedule visibility</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Solution</h2>
    <p>UBus addresses these gaps with a modern web-based platform that allows users to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Search and view buses by route and availability</li>
      <li>Book general tickets using any device</li>
      <li>Track buses in real-time through GPS</li>
      <li>Make secure digital payments</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Live GPS Tracking</h2>
    <p>Using external GPS modules or built-in emergency systems on buses, UBus provides accurate location data to minimize wait times and enhance commuter planning.</p>

    <h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Offline ticketing support in low-network zones</li>
      <li>AI-powered passenger crowd prediction</li>
      <li>Multi-language support for local accessibility</li>
      <li>Dedicated mobile apps for Android and iOS</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Development</h2>
    <p>This project was built during a 2-week internship CRUD program by a team of 4, aimed at improving the daily commute for underserved regions.</p>
